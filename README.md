# Diabetes-Prediction
# What is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces. Learning how to use Machine Learning can help us predict Diabetes. Letâ€™s get started!

# About this project :-
The objective of this project is to classify whether someone has diabetes or not.
Dataset consists of several Medical Variables(Independent) and one Outcome Variable(Dependent)
The independent variables in this data set are :-'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin','BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age'
The outcome variable value is either 1 or 0 indicating whether a person has diabetes(1) or not(0).
# About the Dataset
* Pregnancies :- Number of times a woman has been pregnant
* Glucose :- Plasma Glucose concentration of 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure :- Diastollic Blood Pressure (mm hg)
* SkinThickness :- Triceps skin fold thickness(mm)
* Insulin :- 2 hour serum insulin(mu U/ml)
* BMI :- Body Mass Index ((weight in kg/height in m)^2)
* Age :- Age(years)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction :-scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
* Outcome :- 0(doesn't have diabetes) or 1 (has diabetes)
